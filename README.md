### Project React + Vite
# _Retro Legend_

![](/src/images/firstscreen.png)

This is a project about service for renting retro cars in Utrecht, Netherlands. There are a lot of classic cars here. I know one family that owns 14 retro cars.

People like retro cars, because retro cars are: 
 - beautiful
 - rare
 - they are not like other cars
 - they have a soul, because they are connected with our past.

 The service provides a list of cars. Loginned users can make a reservation for a car and also to add their own car, so other people can rent it.
